            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Alex! You've probably heard of the country called Russia, so I live there. I am a student of computer science in Moscow university.
                I've started my programming activity in 2021 by writing the <a href="https://github.com/defini7/ConsoleGameEngine">ConsoleGameEngine</a> on C++. So
                since that period my main language is still C++ but sometimes I code on C and JavaScript. Most of my coding time I spend on my <a href="https://github.com/defini7/defGameEngine">defGameEngine</a>
                but also there are lot's of different project that you can find on my GitHub profile. Sometimes it's very difficult to find time for programming because
                I need to do other things that I don't even like, let's hope it won't last for the rest of my life.
            </p>
